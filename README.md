## Theme Configuration

The plugin automatically detects your variable collections. For optimal experience:

1. **Naming Convention**: Use descriptive names for your variable collection modes
2. **Color Coding**: The plugin displays colored circles next to each theme name for quick visual identification
3. **Library Collections**: Works seamlessly with published team library collections

### Supported Collections
The plugin is designed to work with cascading theme collections:
- 🌈 Theme (base collection)
- 🌈 Theme 2 (extends Theme)
- 🌈 Theme 3 (extends Theme 2)
- 🌈 Theme 4 (extends Theme 3)
- 🌈 Theme 5 (extends Theme 4)
- 🌈 Theme 6 (extends Theme 5)

## Customization

### Theme Colors
You can customize the color indicators by modifying the `logoConfigData` object in `ui.html`:

```javascript
var logoConfigData = {
  "Shop Old": "#EF4056",
  "Shop": "#E40138",
  "Commercial": "#384ED8",
  "Service Hub": "#384ED8",
  "Car": "#87CEEB",
  "Super Coin": "#F9BC00",
  // Add your theme colors here
};
```

### Theme Names
The plugin automatically detects all available variable collection modes. Simply rename your modes in Figma's variable panel.

## API Limitations

**Note**: Due to Figma API limitations, the "Reset" function cannot completely remove variable mode assignments. Instead, it resets modes to their default (first) state. This is a known limitation acknowledged by Figma's engineering team.

## Compatibility

- **Figma Version**: Works with all recent versions of Figma
- **Collections**: Supports both local and team library variable collections
- **Modes**: Compatible with all variable collection modes
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (Figma Desktop recommended)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Themes not appearing in dropdown**
- Ensure you have variable collections with multiple modes
- Check that collections are properly published (for team libraries)
- Refresh the plugin if collections were recently modified

**Reset not working as expected**
- This is expected behavior due to Figma API limitations
- Reset sets modes to default rather than removing assignments completely

**Plugin not loading**
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure manifest.json is properly formatted
- Try refreshing Figma and reopening the plugin

### Getting Help
- Check the [Issues](../../issues) page for known problems
- Create a new issue with detailed steps to reproduce
